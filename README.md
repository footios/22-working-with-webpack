Speaking of that let's install the first import dependency,

actually two of them with npm install --save-dev,

we install new dependencies and we mark them as development only dependencies

which doesn't really have a big impact

here, doesn't make a difference, we could also use --save in our project but it makes it clear

which dependencies we use only for setting up the build workflow and which dependencies really have

an impact on the running application,

you will see that they will be grouped differently the package.json file later.

Both --save and --save-dev add an entry to package.json so that we can

easily share our project without having to share the big node modules folder too.
